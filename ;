---- NOTES ----
The only files you'll need to edit are in the "blog", "gallery" and 
"configurations" folders.

---- HTML ----
The blog posts need to be written in HTML so here's a quick reference:

- To write a paragraph:
  <p>paragraph contents</p>

- Add a line break:
  <br />

- Make text bold:
  <b>bold text</b>

- Make text italic:
  <i>italic text</i>

- Bold italic text:
  <b><i>bold itaic text</i></b>

- Add a link:
  <a href='https://website.com'>link text</a>

- Link that opens in a new tab (I always use this for outgoing links):
  <a href='https://website.com' target='_blank'>link text</a>

- Horizontal line across the page:
  It's usually just 
  <hr /> 

  but to make it use the site's theme use 
  <p class='hr'><hr /></p>

- Add an image:
  <img src='/path/to/image.jpg'></img>


---- BLOG ----
To make a blog post:

1. Open the "blog.js" file in the "blog" folder with Notepad++ or VsCode.

2. There will be a Javascript variable that looks like this:

  const blogPosts = [
    {
      "title": "Example Blog Entry 2",
      "subheading": "This is another blog post",
      "datePublished": "17/10/2024",
      "categories": ["Category2", "Category3"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Example Blog Entry",
      "subheading": "This is a blog post",
      "datePublished": "16/10/2024",
      "categories": ["Category1", "Category2"]
    }
  ]

  It's pretty self-explanatory, just add the info about the post you wanna 
  make. It reads from top-to-bottom, top being the most recent, so make sure 
  it's at the top. Also make sure the syntax matches exactly, or else it won't 
  work.

  The most important bit to remember is that every entry except for the last 
  should have a comma after the curly brackets.

3. make a new file in the "blog/posts" folder. If your post is called "A Blog 
  Post", the file should be called "a-blog-post.html" (replacing spaces with 
  hyphens and capital letters with lowercase).

4. Write the HTML for your post in that file.
