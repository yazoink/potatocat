-------- NOTES --------
The only files you'll need to edit are in the "blog", "gallery" and 
"configurations" folders.


---- HTML ----
The blog posts need to be written in HTML so here's a quick reference:

- To write a paragraph:
  <p>paragraph contents</p>

- Add a line break:
  <br />

- Make text bold:
  <b>bold text</b>

- Make text italic:
  <i>italic text</i>

- Bold italic text:
  <b><i>bold itaic text</i></b>

- Add a link:
  <a href='https://website.com'>link text</a>

- Link that opens in a new tab (I always use this unless it's a navbar link):
  <a href='https://website.com' target='_blank'>link text</a>

- Horizontal line across the page:
  It's usually just 
  <hr /> 

  but to make it use the site's theme use 
  <p class='hr'><hr /></p>

- Add an image:
  <img src='/path/to/image.jpg'></img>

  The path of the image is from the start of the website folder, so if 
  "image.jpg" is in the "images" folder in the "blog" folder, it would be 
  "/blog/images/image.jpg"
  
  I would also suggest sizing images down as much as you can and/or converting 
  them to WEBP to make sure they load quickly.

  The maximum width an image can display at in a blog post is 498px, so I'd
  suggest sizing it down to that.

- Open an image in a new tab by clicking it:
  <a href='/path/to/image.jpg' target='_blank'>
    <img src='/path/to/image.jpg'></img>
  </a>

- Use a lower resolution image on the page, but open a higher 
  resolution image when clicked:
  <a href='/path/to/full/resolution/image.jpg' target='_blank'>
    <img src='/path/to/downscaled/image.jpg'></img>
  </a>

- Unordered/bullet list:
  <ul>
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 2</li>
    <li>List item 3</li>
  </ul>

- Ordered/numbered list:
  <ol>
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 2</li>
    <li>List item 3</li>
  </ol>


---- BLOG ----
To make a blog post:

1. Open the "blog.js" file in the "blog" folder with Notepad++ or VsCode.

2. There will be a Javascript variable that looks like this:

  const blogPosts = [
    {
      "title": "Example Blog Entry 2",
      "subheading": "This is another blog post",
      "datePublished": "17/10/2024",
      "categories": ["Category2", "Category3"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Example Blog Entry",
      "subheading": "This is a blog post",
      "datePublished": "16/10/2024",
      "categories": ["Category1", "Category2"]
    }
  ]

  It's pretty self-explanatory, just add the info about the post you wanna 
  make. It reads from top-to-bottom, top being the most recent, so make sure 
  it's at the top. Also make sure the syntax matches exactly, or else it won't 
  work.

  The most important things to remember when writing to that file are; 
  every post except for the last should have a comma after the curly brackets 
  and double quotes and backslashes inside the text need to be written as 
  \" and \\.

3. make a new file in the "blog/posts" folder. If your post is called "A Blog 
  Post", the file should be called "a-blog-post.html" (replacing spaces with 
  hyphens and capital letters with lowercase).

4. Write the HTML for your post in that file. There are already some examples, 
  which can safely be left there without showing up on the site, as long as 
  they're not in "blog.js".

To edit the text under the heading, edit the "blogDescription" variable in 
"blog.js".


---- ART GALLERY ----
To add art to the gallery:

1. Put the full resolution version of the image in "/gallery/art/full"
2. Put a downscaled image with the same name in "/gallery/art/thumbnails"
3. Open "/gallery/gallery.js" and find the "artGalleryImages" variable:
  
  const artGalleryImages = [
    "art1.webp",
    "art2.webp",
    "art3.webp"
  ]

  Add the name of the image (it will display the image at the top first).

You can the subtitle and text on the gallery page by changing the values under the 
"artGallery" variable (also in "/gallery/gallery.js").


---- NAVBAR ----
To edit the social links on the navbar:

Open "/configurations/configurations.js". There will be a "socials" 
variable like this:

const socials = [
  {
    "name": "Twitter",
    "url": "https://twitter.com/potatowocat"
  },
  {
    "name": "Ko-fi",
    "url": "https://ko-fi.com/potatocat73467"
  }
]

Add/remove/edit what you want there.
